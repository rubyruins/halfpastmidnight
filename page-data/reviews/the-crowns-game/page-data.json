All in a day’s work, no biggie. It’s cool to see how collected and in touch she is with her powers right from the start.</p>\n<p>Nikolai, in many aspects, is her complete opposite. He lives in the capital, but doesn’t know the love of his mentor the way Vika does. His magic is pretty impressive, specializing in the mechanical rather than the elemental - but you can’t help but feel sorry for him. If it’s any consolation, he has his best friend, the grand prince, Pasha, in his corner. Pasha, though, has his own problems, dealing with Russia’s enemies who might be on the verge of rebellion.</p>\n<p>It doesn't take too long for tensions to start boiling over, which prompts the tsar to initiate the Crown’s Game - a tiebreaker to choose Russia’s next Imperial Enchanter between Vika and Nikolai. They alternate turns to prove their mettle by performing grand feats until the tsar declares a winner. And of course, there’s a catch. <em>Take too long to make your move? You die. Lose the game? You die.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want any chance at winning the actual Game, you’d better get accustomed to blood on your soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s here that The Crown’s Game really picks up, forcing our protagonists into a move one after the other. The tsar starts them off with simple enough tasks to demonstrate their abilities. Vika and Nikolai are pretty powerful, and it shows in their work. I loved the fact that Skye decided to highlight them using their powers, not go into a tedious journey of acquiring them.</p>\n<p>Here comes in a major qualm I had with the nature of their tasks: they rang too hollow. At a time when rumors of rebellion were floating in Russia, our potential Enchanters’ demonstrations felt quite shallow. Sure, they could pull off marvelous aesthetic feats to show their abilities, but it honestly felt like a bit of a letdown. For a position so coveted as that of the Imperial Enchanter, the magic they did just felt… insignificant.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean that it wasn’t enjoyable, though - there’s a lot of creativity involved as they try to outdo the other. Vika is fierce and strong headed, and Nikolai is softer but determined all the same, and it makes for an interesting dynamic as they go head to head.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I both love it and hate it. Which, I think, means I both love and hate myself. I am the Game, and the Game is me. This is what my whole life has led up to, and this will determine the rest of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the game progressing, there’s the added burden of the Nikolai - Vika - Pasha love triangle that seems quite out of place. I don’t think this book needed it at all. It’s not well executed, and it rushes too fast without people even getting to know the other. There are a couple of other good surprises in between, but the twists they soon lead to were somewhat predictable for me.</p>\n<p>As we approach the end, there’s a constant undercurrent of tension throughout as Vika and Nikolai wonder what the other’s up to, and how it could kill them. And I loved it. It’s the last hundred pages that are The Crown’s Game at its best - replete with misery, lies and death as each of our protagonists suffers in their own way. It’s heartbreaking to watch, but done surprisingly well.</p>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<h3>Vika and Nikolai</h3>\n<p>Victoria is a lovable character. Sadly, I've come across too many overpowered, unlikeable female protagonists, but Vika is much more down to earth and relatable. She’s clever, and I really liked how resourceful she was, and how at home she felt with her power.</p>\n<p>Sergei said it was because Vika was like a jinni whose bottle was too small to contain her. One day, I’ll create a world where there are no bottles at all, she thought.</p>\n<p>Nikolai, although a bit softer and more sensitive than his female counterpart, is just as smart. Underneath, he’s just as ruthless as she is, matching her perfectly. You can’t help but feel bad for the both of them as they accept the fate they’re born to with a quiet calm.</p>\n<h3>Pasha</h3>\n<p>Pavel is the grand prince of Russia. But he barely acts like it. Although endearing in the start, it was just hard to get on board with his incredibly naive behavior. He has his moments, but I walked away from him feeling quite underwhelmed, especially considering how he handled the ending.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is Yuliana, Pasha’s younger sister, who becomes my favorite. She’s a fifteen year old princess who’s calm, impersonal, cares about politics and loves her brother fiercely - what’s not to like?</p>\n<h2>Worldbuilding</h2>\n<p>Something that The Crown’s Game sorely lacked in was history. I think Skye really had a chance here to provide some background on Russia, the role of the Enchanter, and why people didn’t know they existed. If being an Imperial Enchanter was such a big thing, why don’t we get more than a few snippets detailing their roles and how Vika or Nikolai would fit into their position?</p>\n<p>Another thing I really didn’t understand was the need to kill off one enchanter in the rare generation that had two of them. The story repeatedly underlined the fact that Nikolai’s and Vika’s powers were vastly different. Having access to different abilities would be far more useful for a tsar, don’t you think?</p>\n<h2>Writing Style</h2>\n<p>For the most part, the writing style is decent and the prose flows well, making for an enjoyable and quick read. We have the occasional bit of gorgeous descriptions where Skye demonstrates her full range of creativity in the form of rock birds, enchanted waterways and some really interesting mechanics. Unfortunately, this doesn’t really stay consistent - and I really wish we had more of it. It would have made for a much more compelling read.</p>\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Crown’s Game had a lot of potential. Personally, I find interpersonal tensions and political intrigue much more fascinating than grand feats of power. I wish it had spent more time on politics, fleshing out human relationships and doing something about the real issues of Russia’s enemies. It certainly had the setting, along with ample opportunity to do so. However, it does make for a pretty quick and enjoyable read with its interesting magic system, quirky characters  and a surprising ending. If you’re looking for stubborn, cunning enchanters battling it for their lives in a world where Hunger Games meets Shadow and Bone, The Crown’s Game might just be the thing for you.</p>","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"date":"January 01, 2022","author":"Evelyn Skye","tags":["Fantasy","Historical","Magic","Russia","Young Adult"],"series":"The Crown's Game","part":1,"title":"The Crown's Game","rating":"07.1","blurb":"Vika Andreyeva can summon the snow and turn ash into gold.
