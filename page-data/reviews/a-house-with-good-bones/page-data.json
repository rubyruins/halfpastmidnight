Kingfisher's work always brings with it a touch of uncanny humor and well-written characters, making for the occasional light-hearted read. What Moves the Dead was the first book I read from this author, soon followed by Nettle &#x26; Bone. Now that I'd come to appreciate her witty writing and whimsically unnerving settings, I soon picked up this one.</p>\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n<p>A House with Good Bones is a story about a house that seems to be haunted, about roses that seem to be too perfect, and about vultures who eye people warily. Just like What Moves the Dead, this one too blends complex interpersonal issues with a touch of horror.</p>\n<p>The story follows Samantha, or Sam as she likes to call herself - on a visit back to her childhood home to stay with her mother, Edith, for a while.  She's an archaeoentomologist (who studies insects in ancient remains) and needs a place to stay before embarking on her next dig. Once home, Sam is immediately struck by the unsettling atmosphere of the house: the once colorful rooms now bleached an almost sterile white, the out-of-place art hanging on the walls, and the strangest feeling that there's someone else there apart from her mother and her.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I know you’re an archaeologist and it’s in your nature to go digging around in the past. But it’s best to let some things lie.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the most part, the story follows your typical haunted house trope as Sam notices the small changes around her, starting from the state of the garden to her mother's increasingly erratic behavior. Sam starts to dig in deeper, beginning to uncover a dark family history that could somehow involve a dead relative and threaten to strangle the house's very foundations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strange, the powers you find sometimes, in a garden at the end of the road.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I felt that the story spent too much time in the phase of watching and discovery, and too little on acting on it. There were too many chapters that consisted of just watching Sam watching TV, drinking wine, and making some witty jokes. While it was fun at first, and Kingfisher's writing rarely feels boring, I didn't mind it. But it turned out that quite a few secrets were lurking in this little house which didn't get a lot of exposition. This is where the last 20% suffers since a lot of the reveals felt quite rushed. I'm not sure if I felt very satisfied with how it ended.</p>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<p>Most of Kingfisher's books have some colorful and strange characters, and this one is no exception. Samantha is well-educated and resourceful, and her dry wit keeps the story from becoming too dark. She's quite determined to get to the bottom of things and doesn't let anyone stop her from it. I also liked her mother, Edith, who was clearly struggling with something but was fiercely trying to keep her daughter safe. Their relationship is complex and sometimes strained, but it's also full of love and understanding.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with family is that they know where all the levers are that make you move. They’re usually the ones who installed the levers in the first place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A couple of other characters are also featured in the book, such as a very impressive handyman, a witchy neighbor, and an adorable baby vulture. I quite liked what the author has done with the vultures in the book.</p>\n<h2>Worldbuilding</h2>\n<p>A House with Good Bones is very atmospheric which made it an immersive experience for me. Set in  Lammergeier Lane in North Carolina, Sam watches as something insidious takes root in her family home. There's some old family history at play here, and it slowly gets revealed in layers as the story progresses. It's not quite what it looks like on the surface, and I'm glad for it. There are some elements of magic involved, but they are subtle and thankfully not too over the top.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there are no flowers in this place only the roots of roses and the things that move between them</p>\n<p>only roots and runners</p>\n<p>only thorns</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The author weaves reveals from the family's murky past with the present day quite well, but what I didn't enjoy was just how long it took to get to them. Almost nothing happened for quite a while, and then, bam - you're hit with ancient stories and magic out of nowhere! It felt a bit disconcerting and also made the final scenes somewhat underwhelming.</p>\n<h2>Writing Style</h2>\n<p>As always, the writing in Kingfisher's books remains one of my favorites. I always love the dark humor that is interspersed in her work. It balances out the paranormal tension, making it easy to breeze through the story in a couple of hours. I’m just wishing that the pacing was better.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the book touches on some interesting themes, such as family secrets, generational trauma, and the power of the past. I immensely enjoyed the constant sense of dread and unease building up through the chapters, which was also one of the highlights of What Moves the Dead for me.</p>\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A House with Good Bones showcases the author's trademark blend of wit and well-crafted prose. While the atmospheric worldbuilding and dialogue shine through, the plot itself wasn't that great. I usually enjoy T. Kingfisher's work, but this might be my least favorite one. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a quick tale in the vein of gothic horror involving a house weighed down with family secrets and very creepy vultures, this could be the one for you.</p>","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"date":"July 02, 2023","author":"T.
