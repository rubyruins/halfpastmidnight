Miller's work ignited in me the curiosity to learn more about Greek mythology, particularly the events surrounding the long Trojan War. Since then, I've embarked on a mission to read more retellings around this particular subject. After going through quite a few of those, I can definitely say that Costanza Casati's Clytemnestra has to be my favorite one so far.</p>\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n<p>As a daughter of King Tyndareus and Leda, the wife of Agamemnon, and the sister of Helen of Troy - Clytemnestra played a pivotal role in the events after the Trojan War ended. Even today, she stands out in Greek history as the queen of Mycenae notorious for her ruthless acts of vengeance.</p>\n<p>Was Clytemnestra truly a villain? Or did her circumstances turn her into one?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She has dared much in life and paid the consequences each time. She has been called “proud,” “savage,” “single-minded,” “mad with ambition,” “a murderess.” She has been called many things, but none of those matter. “It is the will of the gods,” the priestess had told her all those years ago. “You will be despised by many, hated by others, and punished. But in the end, you will be free.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a magnificent retelling from the perspective of this Spartan princess, Costanza Casati examines this very question through the lens of the character herself. It starts from the early years of Clytemnestra and Helen's lives. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised with how far back the book went to show us a glimpse of their childhood before their pivotal roles in history. There are quite a few events in Clytemnstra's early years that I didn't know about... and that shape her character for the future to come.</p>\n<p>Raised as a fighter and strongly protective figure to younger Helen, Clytemnestra is forced into a match by her father, Tyndareus, with the brutal Agamemnon - hungry for glory and epitomizing the worst of Greek brutality.</p>\n<p>Forced into a loveless marriage with a man she hates, she finds herself in a deeply patriarchal society distrustful of her abilities and her role as a woman. Nonetheless, she makes the best of her situation and stands out as a tough ruler capable of running a kingdom while not shying away from the occasional acts of violence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You are an ambitious woman married to a ruthless king. In my experience, ambitious people fall quickly. But not you. You have a talent for survival.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the book hits its high point, it punches you really hard in the gut. Like me, if you have read prior literature about the Trojan War, you might be prepared for what is to come. Nonetheless, it will still hurt you just as bad. That is the beauty of this entire book: even for those of us familiar with the events of the war, the story remains just as interesting, even at over four hundred pages.</p>\n<p>I did find the ending a tad rushed. Although it was set up well in advance, I felt that there were quite a few things happening in quick succession. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed how this story had a bit more of an open ending than the original story.

Unlike some books, this one has a lot of quiet moments that set up relationships with a lot of character development, which is always a big plus!</p>\n<h3>Clytemnestra</h3>\n<p>Clytemnestra is one of my favorite heroines from Greek mythology. This portrayal of her is the best one I have ever read. Casati’s Clytemnestra is made of pure iron, unflinching and refusing to back down in the face of adversity. She is not a flashy, dramatic heroine, but a blade hidden in shadow, honing her anger, waiting for the right moment to strike. This book makes no excuses for her and she fully embraces her true nature.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But vengeance works best when it’s aided by patience. And patience is like a child: it must be nursed so it can grow day after day, feeding on sorrow, until it’s as angry as a bull and as lethal as a poisoned fang.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clytemnestra has a fiercely protective streak in her, loving her family with a strong determination. Her relationships are the heart of this story and I loved how the author explored it throughout the book.</p>\n<h3>The Spartan Siblings</h3>\n<p>Helen, Clytemnestra, and their brothers, Castor and Polydeuces, get a lot of scenes in the story. While Helen is a familiar character, I haven't read a lot about Castor and Polydeuces in modern Greek retellings, so it was really refreshing to know more about them. In fact, the book goes so far as to include even more of their younger siblings, as well as their cousin, Penelope of Ithaca, and some other close relatives, to round out the family.</p>\n<p>I loved how deeply all the siblings' bond is depicted. Although Leda and Tyndareus aren't the best parents, at least their children have each other's backs in a way that is beautiful and heartwarming.</p>\n<p>Another thing I really enjoyed was how Casati gives her side characters quite distinctive voices, even if they don't get a lot of appearances. In fact, this got me quite attached to some of them during the first half, which is why I was disappointed with the loss of focus on them in the second half. Although this story belongs to the titular Clytemnestra, I would have loved a little more closure for the other minor characters.</p>\n<h2>Worldbuilding</h2>\n<p>The story is set across a vast area, from the shores of Greece to the walls of Troy. Most of the background and context is set up, thanks to a pretty detailed family tree provided on the first page and some prior knowledge of the Trojan War. The book does not shy away from showing the bloodthirsty, ruthless nature of the Greeks and how far they are willing to go to achieve glory. It made for a very solid setting as the author creates a beautiful, luxuriant, yet ruthless world with scheming characters.</p>\n<h2>Writing Style</h2>\n<p>The writing feels very polished and lovingly made. I could sense that there was a lot of research put in describing even minor details like the architecture, the clothes, and the ancient Greek traditions, which add so much depth to the book. As a very personal preference, I think I might have enjoyed this book better if it had been written in the first person since that is my preferred style when reading character-driven novels. However, the book still reads beautifully, with lyrical, evocative prose.</p>\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n<p>History remembers Clytemnestra as a notorious murderess, as a ruthless woman burning with a need for vengeance. She might have been all of that, but she was also other things: a daughter, a wife, a mother, and a queen. A woman pushed too far to the edge. A perpetrator of violence, but also a victim of grave injustice. A human trying to take charge of her fate in a world designed to crush and tear her down. <em>A survivor.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for queens, they are either hated or forgotten. She already knows which option suits her better. Let her be hated forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The legacy and spirit of Clytemnestra live on in this book: a triumphant tribute to the Lioness of Mycenae. Costanza Casati makes a strong debut with this tale exploring the themes of revenge, justice, and the complexities of human nature. Making for a thought-provoking, deeply moving retelling, Clytemnestra will stay with you long after you turn its last page.</p>","timeToRead":5,"frontmatter":{"date":"May 21, 2023","author":"Costanza Casati","tags":["Adult","Fantasy","Feminism","Greece","Historical","Retelling","Royalty","Costanza Casati"],"series":"Standalone","part":null,"title":"Clytemnestra","rating":"08.5","goodreads":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61361681-clytemnestra","cover_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e6d45be858da8e289eed3dc9fd20c876/a0844/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e6d45be858da8e289eed3dc9fd20c876/12f4f/cover.jpg 372w,\n/static/e6d45be858da8e289eed3dc9fd20c876/5ea03/cover.jpg 743w,\n/static/e6d45be858da8e289eed3dc9fd20c876/a0844/cover.jpg 1486w","sizes":"(min-width: 1486px) 1486px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e6d45be858da8e289eed3dc9fd20c876/66870/cover.webp 372w,\n/static/e6d45be858da8e289eed3dc9fd20c876/f347d/cover.webp 743w,\n/static/e6d45be858da8e289eed3dc9fd20c876/6bbe0/cover.webp 1486w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1486px) 1486px, 100vw"}]},"width":1486,"height":2200}}}},"fields":{"articleTitle":"Clytemnestra","roundRating":8.5}},"otherBooksInSeriesByAuthor":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"title":"Clytemnestra","author":"Costanza Casati","series":"Standalone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
